# The Kindred Bot 
The Kindred Bot is a bot created for Discord servers.  It is made specifically for virtual players of the World of Darkness tabletop RPG, Vampire: the Masquerade.

## Commands
1. **!greetings** -- The Kindred Bot will send you a greeting when you type this command into a server text channel.
2. **!gif** *subject* -- The Kindred Bot will return a single gif from Giphy of the SUBJECT you specify.  For example, typing "!gif buffy the vampire slayer" will return a random gif from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

## Text Prompts
1. "**I love vampires**" -- The Kindred Bot will react to your message if you type the above prompt.

### Additional Things to Know
I will make updates to this bot periodically.  Check back every now and then for new commands and prompts.  If you have a suggestion for a new bot feature, please email me at jonayah@thinkhalcyon.com.

Please note that this bot is currently only available on my testing server.  Once I am ready for the bot to be downloaded publically, I will remove the restraint on which servers/channels can use it.

Thank you!
